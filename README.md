# Connect4
Connect 4 game in Python utilizing the minimax algorithm for the computer AI. The minimax algorithm utilitzes a depth variable to determine the number of future plays it models when determining its next move. This variable impacts difficulty as follows:

- Moderate difficulty when using a depth of 4 (nearly instant computation time)
- Challenging difficulty when using a depth of 5 (computation time increases to ~0.5 seconds)
- Extreme difficulty when using a depth of 6 (computation time increases significantly) 

Computation time becomes unreasonable beyond a depth of 6
